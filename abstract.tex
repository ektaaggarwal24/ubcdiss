\chapter{Abstract}

 \ac{CPS} consist of software and physical components which are knitted together and interact with each other continuously. \ac{CPS} have been targets of security attacks due to their safety-critical nature and relative lack of protection. Specification based \ac{IDS} using data, temporal, data temporal and time, and logical correlations have been proposed in the past. But none of the approaches except the ones using logical correlations take into account the main ingredient in the operation of \ac{CPS}, namely the use of physical properties. On the other hand, \ac{IDS} that use physical properties either require the developer to define invariants manually, or have designed their \ac{IDS} for a specific \ac{CPS}. This study proposes a \ac{CORGIDS}, a generic \ac{IDS} capable of detecting security attacks by inferring the logical correlations of the physical properties of a \ac{CPS}, and checking if they adhere to the predefined framework. A \ac{CORGIDS}-based prototype is built and used for detecting attacks on two \ac{CPS} - \ac{UAV} and \ac{SAP}. It is found that \ac{CORGIDS} achieves a precision of  95.70\%, and a recall of 87.90\%, while detecting attacks with modest memory and performance overheads.
