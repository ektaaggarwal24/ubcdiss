\chapter{Lay Summary}

\acf{CPS} are composed of software and physical components which are deeply intertwined.  \ac{CPS} are being deployed in security-critical scenarios such as medical devices and autonomous cars, and therefore have been targets of security attacks due to their safety-critical nature and relative lack of protection. However, it is essential to protect these systems, as they form an indispensable part of our lives. Various \acf{IDS} have been proposed in past however, none of the approaches except the ones using logical correlations take into account the physical properties of \ac{CPS}. This thesis proposes \acf{CORGIDS}, a generic \acf{IDS} capable of detecting security attacks by inferring the logical correlations of the physical properties of a \ac{CPS}, and checking if they adhere to the predefined framework. A \ac{CORGIDS}-based prototype is built and was successfully used for detecting attacks on two example \ac{CPS}s.
